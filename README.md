# Planning Taylor

## Description
In this case, we are examining a project initiated to enhance the efficiency of language section planning, specifically designed for Mary Stephenson, the responsible party for the language section. This initiative roots from the critical need to address the significant time and effort expended in the creation and updating of LV1/LV2 planning, which Mary found unsatisfactory due to its reliance on manual processes such as the use of post-it notes or Excel spreadsheets. These methods, while traditional, are prone to errors, time-consuming, and lack the flexibility required for efficient schedule management.

The sponsor of this project is the organization overseeing the language section, which has identified the inefficiencies and sought a technological solution to streamline the process. This organization, while not detailed in figures, is presumably an educational institution or a language training provider that values innovation and efficiency in its operations. The key elements of this organization likely include a commitment to language education, a structured curriculum that necessitates careful planning of language levels (LV1/LV2), and a dynamic schedule that requires frequent updates.

The genesis of the project came directly from the identified need by Mary Stephenson to improve the planning process within the language section she oversees. The manual methods currently in use were deemed inadequate, leading to the search for a solution that could save time and reduce the margin for error.
